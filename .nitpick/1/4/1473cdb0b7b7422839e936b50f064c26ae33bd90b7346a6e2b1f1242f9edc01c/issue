Title: Timestamp each line of framebuffer dump
Type: Feature
Units_of_Work: 1000
--
Currently most lines are prepended with a timestamp when being output. This doesn't work for multi-line strings which are output at one go, only the first line has the time prepended. This makes the logs look a bit funny and difficult to just cut out the leading columns if they aren't wanted.

It should be easy enough to look for newlines and insert a copy of the current timestamp there. This would timestamp all the lines of a framebuffer dump individually.
