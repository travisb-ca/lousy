	<p>
	Lousy is a test framework and test runner built upon Python's unittest module. It is useful
	for any language and provides several useful facilities not present in most test frameworks.
	The most notable of these is the bug tracker integration. When using a supported bug tracker
	Lousy is able to update bugs in that tracker with test failures and create new bugs based
	upon previously unrecorded test failures. More than just the testname which failed, Lousy
	will match the output of the test against a set of regexes to determine more accurately
	which bug matches the particular failure or warning.

	This section will tell you all you need to begin writing simple tests with Lousy. More
	complex portions of the Lousy test API will be described in later sections.
	</p>

	<a name="types_of_tests"></a><a href="#types_of_tests"><h1>Types of Tests</h1></a>
	<p>
	Lousy makes the distinction between three classes of tests: unit tests, component tests,
	slow tests and constrained tests. Unit tests are intended to test a single class or
	function, using stubs to stand in for the rest of the application. Component tests are
	intended to test larger unit, often a subsystem or executable. Slow tests are defined by the
	length of time it takes to run the tests. Slow tests obviously take what would otherwise be
	an annoying length of time to run. Constrained tests are tests which have some special
	requirements such as extreme amounts of memory or some hardware. Constrained tests are tests
	which can not, generally, be run in parallel.
	</p>

	<p>
	The only reason for this distinction is to make it easy to filter which type of test to run
	at a particular time. For example, if you want your tests to complete quickly you might only
	run the unit and component tests. If you have more patience but no special resources then
	you might run the slow tests as well but not the constrained tests. The constrained tests
	you would only run when you have the necessary resources available. Lousy will run unit
	tests, component tests and slow tests in parallel to complete testing more quickly, but
	won't run constrained tests in parallel. Constrained tests can optionally be run only if the
	constraints are met.
	</p>

	<p>
	Lousy has a simple directory structure to store the tests. There is the top level directory
	for tests which must be named <tt>tests</tt>. Beneath that there is one directory for each
	type of test: <tt>unit</tt>, <tt>component</tt>, <tt>slow</tt>, <tt>constrained</tt>. All of
	these directories must exist for Lousy to run correctly. Lousy should be run in the parent
	directory of the <tt>tests</tt>.
	</p>

	<p>
	When run Lousy will traverse into the tests directory to enumerate and run the tests of the
	type selected. Lousy configures the Python interpreter such that from those test files you
	can import any module in the <tt>tests</tt> directory with a simple import. This is
	especially useful if you have some project specific utility classes or functions you wish to
	use in your tests.
	</p>

	<p>
	Within each of those test files there are one or more TestCase classes. These are classes
	which inherit from lousy.TestCase and contain the setup and teardown for all the tests
	within that class. Tests within those classes must start with <i>test</i> in their name and
	take no extra arguments. For more details about the contents of the various TestCase methods
	see the next section on the basic API.

	<p>
	Lousy is built on top of the Python unittest module. Until this section is written more
	fully you should look at the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html">Python
		unittest documentation</a>. The most important differences is that you should import
	lousy and not unittest and your test case classes should inherit from lousy.TestCase
	instead of unittest.TestCase.
