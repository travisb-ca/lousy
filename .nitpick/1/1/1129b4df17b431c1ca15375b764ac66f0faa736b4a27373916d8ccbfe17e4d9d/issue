It'd be nice to be able to specify a timeout for any particular test such that any long running tests don't have to add that infrastructure themselves. I'm not sure exactly how I could accomplish this. There doesn't seem to be any trivial way of cancelling a thread, they seem to only be able to voluntarily terminate.
