Title: Add Framebuffer scrollback
Type: Feature
Units_of_Work: 1000
--
Currently all the VTTY types assume that they just have a single framebuffer and have no scroll back. However, some commands, such as ^]M (reverse index) scroll back in the scroll back. Support for a scroll back buffer should be added.
