There are some, not terribly many but some, terminal control codes which have the terminal send a response to the host. Currently the VTTY infrastructure works off a mirrored output and so doesn't have the capability to respond. This should be supported in order to really be complete.

The biggest question is how to rationalize this with the character-based and line-based process interaction models.
